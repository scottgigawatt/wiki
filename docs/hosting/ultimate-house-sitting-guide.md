## 🌴 Rules & Regulations 🌴

Hey there, fabulous house sitters! 🏠✨ We're thrilled you're here to hold down the fort and splash around in our little slice of paradise. Here's your ultimate guide to keeping things chic, safe, and sassy while you enjoy our home and pool. Let's dive in! 💦

## Poolside Etiquette 🌊💅

1. **Safety First, Darling!**
    - No running, diving, or channeling your inner Olympian gymnast. The pool is for floating and fabulousness, not trips to the ER. 💁‍♀️🚫
    - **Use the Steps, or Else!**: Anyone who dares to step on the side of the pool instead of using the steps to properly enter will be scheduled to be beheaded. Seriously, use the steps. 👑⚔️
    - **Do not step on the pool railing**: The railing isn't designed as a step, please step over it and onto the designated pool steps. 🚷🛑👣

2. **Glamorous Cleanup**
    - Skim the pool daily to keep it looking pristine. No one likes swimming with leaves and bugs, even if they are part of nature's accessories. 🏊‍♂️✨
    - Vacuum the bottom and brush the sides as needed. If you're pool-sitting for a short period, don't even worry about this! 🧹🧽💦

3. **Chemistry Queen**
    - Check the pool chemicals once a week. Chlorine and pH levels need to be just right for that perfect Instagram-worthy swim. If you're unsure, consult the pool manual - it's like a beauty regimen for the water. 🧪💧
    - Shock the pool once a week during the peak heat season 🥵. Two gallons of shock in the evening and let her simmer overnight, undisturbed. 💧🌙⏳

## House Rules 🏠🎉

1. **Feed the Felines**
    - Our cats are divas and demand timely room service.
        - **Indoor-Only Royalty** 🐱: One Weruva gravy packet per day, please. Verify automated feeders are set with the correct time ⏱
            - To set the time, long-press "set" until the screen turns blue and you hear a beep. Press the ⬆ and ⬇ buttons to adjust hour, press Set, adjust minutes, and press Set once more. This takes you to adjusting the feeding times which are already set, so leave it alone and in about 20 seconds it will save settings.
        - **Outdoor Loving Adventurers** 🐈: Kibble and designated canned gravy in the morning and evening, with fresh water always available. Bonus points for chin scratches and belly rubs.

2. **Weed Warriors Unite! 🌱**
    - Feel free to pull any weeds you see. Think of it as a therapeutic way to channel your inner gardener.
    - **Special Mission**: If you spot poison ivy, remove it with care. Gloves are your new best friends here, plastic bags for additional protection can be found in the main room utility closet where outdoor kitty food is. We appreciate the extra love! 💚🧤
    - If it's extra hot, please water the tender seedlings! They could use all the love they can get as they get established in the tiered garden beds 🌱🌻

## Fun & Frivolous Guidelines 🎈

1. **Floaties and Fun**
    - Inflatable unicorns, flamingos, and doughnuts are encouraged. A pool party isn't complete without whimsical flotation devices. 🦄🍩

2. **Music Vibes**
    - Use the large speaker to keep the tunes going but be mindful of the neighbors. We want to stay fabulous, not infamous. 🎶🌟

3. **Snack Station**
    - Poolside snacks should be light and refreshing. Think fruit platters, veggie sticks, and a cheeky glass of rosé. 🍇🥒🍷
    - Find refreshing seltzers 🧉 in the mini-fridge downstairs, and check out the dining room sideboard if you're feeling extra saucy 🍹

4. **Dress Code: Fabulous**
    - Stylish swimwear is a must. Feel free to raid our stash if you didn't bring your own. Life's too short for boring swimsuits. 🩱🌞
    - **S P F!!** Keep that skin gorgeous and melanoma-free! Find extra sunscreen and towels in the hallway closet upstairs. 🧴🧁☀️

## Serious Business 💼

1. **Emergency Contacts**
    - Our contact info is on the fridge. In case of an emergency, don't hesitate to reach out. We trust you, but just in case, know we've got your back.

2. **Keep it Clean**
    - Tidy up after yourself. A clean space is a happy space, and we want you to enjoy your stay to the fullest. 🧹🌟

3. **Pool Cover**
    - The pool is covered during the winter, so don't worry about covering it at all during the summer 🛡️💦
