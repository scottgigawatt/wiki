# :material-pool: Hosting and Pool Maintenance

## 🌴 Rules & Regulations 🌴

Hey there, fabulous house sitters! 🏠✨ We're thrilled you're here to hold down the fort and splash around in our little slice of paradise. Here's your ultimate guide to keeping things chic, safe, and sassy while you enjoy our home and pool. Let's dive in! 💦

## Poolside Etiquette 🌊💅

1. **Safety First, Darling!**
    - No running, diving, or channeling your inner Olympian gymnast. The pool is for floating and fabulousness, not trips to the ER. 💁‍♀️🚫
    - **Use the Steps, or Else!**: Anyone who dares to step on the side of the pool instead of using the steps to properly enter will be scheduled to be beheaded. Seriously, use the steps. 👑⚔️

2. **Glamorous Cleanup**
    - Skim the pool daily to keep it looking pristine. No one likes swimming with leaves and bugs, even if they are part of nature's accessories. 🏊‍♂️✨

3. **Chemistry Queen**
    - Check the pool chemicals twice a week. Chlorine and pH levels need to be just right for that perfect Instagram-worthy swim. If you're unsure, consult the pool manual – it's like a beauty regimen for the water. 🧪💧

## House Rules 🏠🎉

1. **Feed the Felines**
    - Our cats are divas and demand timely room service.
        - **Indoor-Only Royalty** 🐱: Fancy Feast twice a day, please.
        - **Outdoor Loving Adventurers** 🐈: Kibble in the morning and evening, with fresh water always available. Bonus points for chin scratches and belly rubs.

2. **Weed Warriors Unite! 🌱**
    - Feel free to pull any weeds you see. Think of it as a therapeutic way to channel your inner gardener.
    - **Special Mission**: If you spot poison ivy, remove it with care. Gloves are your new best friends here. We appreciate the extra love! 💚🧤

## un & Frivolous Guidelines 🎈

1. **Floaties and Fun**
    - Inflatable unicorns, flamingos, and doughnuts are encouraged. A pool party isn't complete without whimsical floatation devices. 🦄🍩

2. **Music Vibes**
    - Keep the tunes going but be mindful of the neighbors. We want to stay fabulous, not infamous. 🎶🌟

3. **Snack Station**
    - Poolside snacks should be light and refreshing. Think fruit platters, veggie sticks, and a cheeky glass of rosé. 🍇🥒🍷

4. **Dress Code: Fabulous**
    - Stylish swimwear is a must. Feel free to raid our stash if you didn't bring your own. Life's too short for boring swimsuits. 🩱🌞

## Serious Business 💼

1. **Emergency Contacts**
    - Our contact info is on the fridge. In case of an emergency, don't hesitate to reach out. We trust you, but just in case, know we've got your back.

2. **Keep it Clean**
    - Tidy up after yourself. A clean space is a happy space, and we want you to enjoy your stay to the fullest. 🧹🌟

3. **Pool Cover**
    - If you're leaving for an extended period, please cover the pool. It keeps things safe and clean, just like a good skincare routine. 🛡️💦

We're beyond grateful for your help and hope you enjoy your time here. Remember, our home is your home, and we want you to feel comfortable, happy, and maybe even a bit pampered. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out.

Happy house sitting and pool partying! 🌴🏠✨
