## Formatting questions

### Why Aren't My Nested List Items Rendering?

If your nested bulleted or numbered lists appear as single-level lists, they might not be correctly indented. Ensure you use 4 spaces for each level of indentation. To avoid this issue, use Visual Studio Code for your edits along with these helpful plugins:

- **[markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint)**: Automatically checks your markdown files for formatting issues.
- **[Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one)**: Provides comprehensive markdown support, including shortcuts, table of contents generation, and enhanced preview features.
